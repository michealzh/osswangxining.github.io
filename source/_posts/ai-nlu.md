## NLU

rasa NLU is an open source tool for intent classification and entity extraction.

Rasa Core takes in structured input: intents and entities, button clicks, etc., and decides what your bot should do next.

Rather than writing a bunch of if/else statements, a Rasa bot learns from real conversations. A probabilistic model chooses which action to take, and this can be trained using supervised, reinforcement, or interactive learning.
